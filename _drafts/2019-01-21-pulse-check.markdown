Here's a scenario that frequently catches me off guard — it might sound familiar to you: I'm preparing for a design review, excited to share my work. I think I've really nailed it. But when I present to my stakeholders, and the response is brief: 

"Could we explore other options?" 

My head spins. I was _sure_ I had everything right. What did I miss?

This stings. It's hard enough to hear a challenging response that you expected; to be caught off-guard is infinitely worse.

I'd like to share a workshop I've designed to prevent these surprises on my own team. Using this format, I recently had 7 teammates share their thoughts on 25 different pieces of design. The results — both quantitative and qualitative — are helping us find the areas we are most aligned on, as well as those we need to find better common ground.
