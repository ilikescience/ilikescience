"Could we explore other options?" 

If you've been a part of design reviews, you've heard this question.

When I hear it, my heart breaks. It tells me that my team is out of alignment. It means that the work I'm sharing isn't meeting everyone's expectations.

To prevent . Using this format, I recently had 7 teammates share their thoughts on 25 different pieces of design. The results, both quantitative and qualitative, tell us a lot. We're learning we're we're aligned, andwhere we need to find better common ground.

I hope that this format helps your team avoid the friction of creative imbalance, too.

## Planning

### Decide who should attend

Invite at least five teammates to the workshop. If you feel comfortable as a facilitator, invite as many as ten. Larger groups are less likely to be aligned, but the more participants there are, the more the group will learn.

Be inclusive of all roles and responsibilities. Invite collaborators and colleagues that you interact with every day, regardless of their contributions to the team's creative output.

### Decide what you need to align on

During the exercise, you'll poll the group using a **Likert Scale.** You've probably seen a Likert Scale before: it consists of a statement, followed by a 1-to-5 rating. A 1 means 'I strongly disagree with this statement," a 5 means "I strongly agree with this statement," and 2 to 4 correspond with the degrees between.

Pick one to three statements that address your team's needs. Are you working on a marketing team? Choose statements about the company's brand. A product team? Your statements might be about accessibility, complexity, or usability.

In Bitly's most recent pulse check, we responded to the following statements:

1. I like this image.
2. This image reflects Bitly's current brand.
3. This image is what Bitly should look like in the future.

### Gather your materials

A week before the workshop, ask everyone to send you a few images they like. Here's what I include in my email to participants:

> **What I need from you:** Please send me (don’t reply all!) what you’d like the group to see. Take a screenshot — it can be a picture of software, of a website, a doodle of your own, or just a picture of words you like. The more varied, the better.

#### A note about remote teams

You don’t need your team to be in the same room to run this workshop. If some (or all!) of your team is remote, use real-time feedback tools like Slack, Google Docs, and Zoom/Hangouts/Bluejeans/etc.
