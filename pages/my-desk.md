I've been asked a few times by coworkers what the stuff on my desk is, so here's a quick reference guide.

**Laptop** - 13" MacBook Pro. I use my computer in clamshell mode at my desk; I find that having more than one screen isn't really that useful.

**Display** - [Dell Ultrasharp 27"](https://amzn.to/2Tiafkb){:target="_blank"}, provided by Bitly. The Matte finish is the best feature on Dell displays, which works nicely with the giant windows directly behind me.

**Case** - [a matte black plastic cover by MOSISO](https://amzn.to/2DnZ83I){:target="_blank"}. There are a million companies that make the same case, and I have no particular brand affiliation.

**Display stand** - [Grovemade](https://grovemade.com/product/walnut-monitor-stand/?initial=64){:target="_blank"}. After I purchased this, Grovemade started selling a [newer version](https://grovemade.com/product/walnut-desk-shelf/?initial=342){:target="_blank"} that looks a little neater.

**Laptop stand** - [Omoton Macbook Stand](https://amzn.to/2Tjekog){:target="_blank"}. This thing is a very functional piece of furniture, It's heavy, and has a nice grip on the bottom, so it's easy to stash my laptop there.

**Power/USB hub** - [Dell Universal Dock](https://amzn.to/2DpwJdr){:target="_blank"}. This is my favorite piece of technology on my desk. It does three things with a _single USB-C cable:_

1. Charges the laptop
2. Connects the display to the laptop
3. Connects all of the various dongles/chargers to the laptop

Being able to plug and unplug a single cable feels. so. good.

**Keyboard** - [Microsoft Sculpt Ergonomic Keyboard](https://amzn.to/2S0Eue5){:target="_blank"}. In the past few years I got a little nutty about RSI and ergonomics. I like the Sculpt keyboard; it's comfy, stays clean, and has a sweet detached numberpad.

**Mouse** - [Logitech MX Vertical Mouse](https://amzn.to/2ThKUqx){:target="_blank"}. Also in the nutty ergonomic camp, a vertical mouse is a huge upgrade from the torture device that is a traditional mouse. The Logitech version works via Bluetooth or dongle, has a nice clean look, and is generally a great conversation piece.

**Mousepad** - [Ugmonk Leater Mousepad](https://shop.ugmonk.com/products/premium-leather-mousepad-black){:target="_blank"}. I don't really need the mousepad for the mouse to work properly â€” instead, it serves as a comfy resting spot for my wrist.

**Phone charger** - [Anker Wireless Charger](https://amzn.to/2Thlidj){:target="_blank"}. This was the last piece to the cordless puzzle. While it's not the prettiest thing on my desk, it's so nice to be able to pick up and put down my phone without plugging/unplugging.

**Headphones (not pictured)** - [Urbanears Plattan 2](https://amzn.to/2Tj06nh){:target="_blank"}. I have a long headphone extension cable running from the USB hub, under my desk, to a hook where my headphones live. The Urbanears are a good pair of $40 headphones, but they get a little uncomfortable after a few hours of wear.

**Pen cup** - [Grovemade](https://grovemade.com/product/walnut-pen-cup/?initial=80){:target="_blank"}. I feel a little silly about this, but it looks nice and keeps me from carrying pens around all day.

**Water bottle** - [Soma](https://drinksoma.com/products/glass-water-bottle){:target="_blank"}. A glass water bottle is really nice. Having something that looks nice on my desk is a good reminder to stay hydrated.
