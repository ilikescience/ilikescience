**“I don’t know”** is the most powerful statement in design.

It’s hard to say. Designers are expected to know the answers. Saying “I don’t know” can feel like saying “I’m not doing my job.” But it doesn’t have to be like that.

In a parallel universe, designers are sleuths. Every software company has a crack team of UX researchers armed with methods of untangling even the most complicated business questions. Awards are given for case studies, not screenshots.

Design schools teach writing, statistics, and behavioral economics.

Designers read Neilsen Norman Group religiously. Google, Facebook, and Microsoft all publish open-source research journals. Young designers practice by re-creating their results.

Most software teams are optimizing for something. Most of the optimizers are optimizing for speed. I still hear “move fast and break things,” despite the fact that Facebook moved fast and broke democracy.

What if instead of optimizing for speed or quantity or quality,  a software team optimizes for learning? Learning can mean finding right way to do things, but it can also mean finding the wrong way to do things. On the balance of knowledge, ‘right way’ and ‘wrong way’ weigh the same.

How to optimize for learning:

1. Work with user research to define a hypothesis
2. Find the smallest possible change you can deliver to validate or invalidate your hypothesis
3. Implement the change, deliver to 100% of users
4. Validate or invalidate your hypothesis with quantitative and qualitative measurements
5. Record and review what you learned
6. Repeat × ∞

For instance, when a product manager asks “How do we increase conversions of free users into paying users?” the team says “I don’t know. Let’s find out.” The team writes a hypothesis, then builds and delivers an update to the product.

Maybe the features are unclear, so the team adds makes the pricing page easier to read.

Maybe the upgrade form is too complicated, so the team makes more fields optional.

Maybe free users don’t see the value of upgrading, so the team introduces a free trial.

At each stage, the team can succeed in increasing conversions. But even if they don’t, they’ve learned more about the users and the product. By reviewing what they’ve learned, the team writes better hypotheses. Better hypotheses lead to more knowledge. Learning compounds.

By the way, A/B testing does not optimize for learning. To A/B test, you must build both A and B, but you only get to see how half of users respond to each. Learning-focused teams move A→B→C, measuring how 100% of users respond to every change.

Optimizing for learning requires embracing unknowns. It forces exploration, and rewards risk-taking. When new knowledge is shared, each new iteration is safer, more confident, and even more educational.

Designers shouldn’t be responsible for delivering the truth, only pointing in the right direction. So next time you’re asked a question, try confidently answering: **“I don’t know. Let’s find out.”**
