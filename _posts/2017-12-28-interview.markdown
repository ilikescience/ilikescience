I like job interviews.

I participated in a lot of job interviews in 2017.  I interviewed extensively before starting at SoundCloud, and then again on my way to my current position at The Wall Street Journal.

As a candidate, interviews are full of fascinating cultural signals about the organization.

When designing my own interviews, I have a go-to question:

**Tell me about a time that you were wrong.**

This question sends strong cultural signals to the applicant. It allows the applicant to pack meaningful personal information into their answer. It’s easy to understand, and works for every level of every position.

## What the question tells an applicant about the organization

Most interviews waste a lot of time talking about getting things right. 

- You should come work for us because we get things right.
- You should hire me because I get things right. 
- How will you make the company get things right more often?
- How will this company help me get things right?

Being right is great, but it’s boring. Being right doesn’t lead to self-reflection or growth. Being right is often misattributed. Being right is expected.

By asking about a time the candidate was wrong, you make an important acknowledgement: being wrong happens. You also show that you value balance, reflection, honesty, candor, and humility.

When you ask the question, your posture while listening to the answer can communicate a lot. Listen actively. You’ll signal your interest in learning from getting it wrong, too.

## What the answer tells the interviewer about the candidate

A quick answer might mean that the candidate has spent time understanding their experience. They're comfortable to acknowledging where they fell short.

A candidate may have to work through their answer. You can learn a lot by listening to someone reflecting on an experience they’re not quite as comfortable with. The candidate might talk candidly, or might be sheepish. They may collect a few related experiences, or go deep on one.

Some candidates may not have an answer. Encourage them to think through it and follow up.

Rarely, you’ll find someone who isn’t wrong. Don’t hire this person.

## [Being wrong](/writing/wrong.html) is hard.

Recognizing that you were wrong is hard, too. To actually talk to another person about what you got wrong is emotionally challenging. Give the candidate some time with this question, and you’ll learn a lot about them.
