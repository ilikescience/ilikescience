The advantage of Argos over other content metric platforms is the proprietary **content score**. Creating the scoring algroithm was challenging, but presenting it in a simple manner proved to be the best way to communicate its statistical underpinnings.

Designing Argos occured in a number of phases over the course of 2015.

Initial layout concepts centered around a simple 1-column layout that could hold a number of components in a rigid hierarchy, maintaining a consistent time-scale on the horizontal axis. This would later become a core design concept for [Spacetime](/projects/spacetime).

Later, the complexity of the components necessitated a more traditional dashboard layout, spanning multiple columns and allowing for more flexible hierarchy.
