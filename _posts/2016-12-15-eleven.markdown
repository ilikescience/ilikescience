Eleven Magazine is a free monthly music magazine. It was started in 2006 by a group of people, including myself, at Washington University in St. Louis.

Over the course of 4 years, we managed (with the help of university funding) to put out 20 or so issues, learning the ropes of publishing a magazine.

In 2009, me and two of the original staffers took the magazine from a college-funded endeavor to a full-fledged ad-supported publishing company.
