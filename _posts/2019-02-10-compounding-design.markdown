I recently read [an essay on 'compounding knowledge.'](https://fs.blog/2019/02/compounding-knowledge/). Compounding knowledge creates a snowball effect, one that Warren Buffet has used to become the most successful investor of all time:

> While most of us focus on consuming information that we won’t care about next month, let alone next year, Buffett focused on knowledge and companies that change very, very slowly or not at all. 

Compounding knowledge builds on itself, and doesn't become irrelevant over time.

The opposite of compounding knowledge is 'expiring knowledge.' Expiring knowledge has three markers:

>  First, it’s marketed to you. Second, lacking details and nuance, it’s easily digestible ... it’s commonly telling you what happened, not why it happened or under what conditions it might happen again. Third, it won’t be relevant in a month or a year.

I think the same concept can be applied to design.

## What is compounding design?

Compounding design, like compounding knowledge, stays relevant over a long period of time. It might be domain-specific, but it isn't limited to a single application. Compounding design often is more about the process than the results. Compounding design benefits both the designer and the audience.

[Design principles](/writing/principles) are an example compounding design. Design principles create positive feedback loops, improving the design that follows them. The process of writing design principles improves the team that writes them.

Design systems are another example of compounding design. They help designers, engineers, and end users by creating a consistent foundation for rapid iteration and improvement. Well-built and well-maintained design systems can influence a product for years, even influencing similar products. [Material Design](https://material.io/), love it or hate it, is a great example of compounding design.

## What is expiring design?

Expiring design is immediately useful, but quickly becomes useless. It captures the state of a problem at a moment in time. Expiring design, unlike expiring knowledge, is very detailed. It is single-use.

You can recognize expiring design by its filename. 'Layout2_revision3_final' is an expiring design.

Expiring design benefits the designer or the audience, but seldom both. Detailed static mockups help a designer communicate with engineers, but don't reflect the dynamic and interactive state of software.
